First order logic prover
==============
This is a library which contains:

 - Backward chaining algorithm
 - Dependent typed First order logic 
 - Forward chaining algorithm
 - Gentzen system
 - Parser for parsing FOL.
 - Resolution method
 - Unify

Dependency: See .pro. **Use a lot of C++1y feature so need a good compiler.**

Build: This is a header only library. Include the header you want.

Document: Just ask in issue. I'm not writing documents when no one seems interested.
